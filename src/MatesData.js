        it can live hapily with most of the same size freshwater fishes, including
        betta fish. Neon Tetras prefer to stay in groups of at least six since they are
        shoaling fishes. Further, when Neon Tetras and Betta fish stay in the same tank, they
        won't interact much since Neon Tetras spend majority of their time midwater and Betta fish
        spend majority of its time top half of the water column.`

        one of the best tank mates for Betta fish. Further, Corydoras Catfish also prefer to live in groups of at least
        five different other individuals. Last but not least, Corydoras Catfish spend most of their time live at the bottom
        of the tank, so they will not interact with the Betta much.`

        like Betta fish, come in a variety of colors and shapes. However, it is preferable 
        to obtain feeder guppies rather than fancy guppies since the flowing fins on fancy 
        guppies would most likely attract the male betta in your tank. Guppies are resilient 
        and kind, and they may live alone or in groups. As a result, you must determine whether 
        to purchase a large number of guppies or just one. Last but not least, because gruppies 
        reproduce quickly, it is best to have only one gender of guppy in the tank at a time to avoid
        the Betta hunting for the newborn gruppies.`
